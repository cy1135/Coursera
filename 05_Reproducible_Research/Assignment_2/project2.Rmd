## Project Title

U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Storm Database Analysis

## Synopsis

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

#### Questions to Answer

* Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the 𝙴𝚅𝚃𝚈𝙿𝙴 variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?  

* Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

## Data Processing

[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2] (Storm Data)  
[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf] (National Weather Service Storm Data Documentation)  
[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2FNCDC%20Storm%20Events-FAQ%20Page.pdf] (National Climatic Data Center Storm Events FAQ)  

The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.

Download, extract and read CSV file
```{r eval = TRUE}
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2",
              dest="stormdata.bz2",
              method="curl")

```

Subset data to records that have fatalities, injuries related only
```{r eval = TRUE}
fData <- subset(data, subset = data$fatalities > 0)
iData <- subset(data, subset = data$injuries > 0)
phyData <- rbind(fData, iData)
```

```{r eval = TRUE}
data <- rbind(phyData, ecoData)
```

```

Upper property and crop exponent multipliers
Map multipliers to numeric values
```{r eval = TRUE}
data$propdmgexp <- toupper(data$propdmgexp)
data$cropdmgexp <- toupper(data$cropdmgexp)

pDmgExp <- c("\"\"" = 10^0,
             "-"    = 10^0, 
             "+"    = 10^0,
             "0"    = 10^0,
             "1"    = 10^1,
             "2"    = 10^2,
             "3"    = 10^3,
             "4"    = 10^4,
             "5"    = 10^5,
             "6"    = 10^6,
             "7"    = 10^7,
             "8"    = 10^8,
             "9"    = 10^9,
             "H"    = 10^2,
             "K"    = 10^3,
             "M"    = 10^6,
             "B"    = 10^9)

data$propdmgexp <- pDmgExp[as.character(data$propdmgexp)]
data$propdmgexp[is.na(data$propdmgexp)] <- 10^0

cDmgExp <- c("\"\"" = 10^0,
             "?"    = 10^0,
             "0"    = 10^0,
             "K"    = 10^3,
             "M"    = 10^6,

Aggregate data for physical data, calculating totals
```{r eval = TRUE}
aggregatedPhysicalData <- aggregate(cbind(fatalities, injuries) ~ evtype, data = data, FUN = sum)
aggregatedPhysicalData$total <- aggregatedPhysicalData$fatalities + aggregatedPhysicalData$injuries
```

Determine events with the highest physical impact, by aggregating data
```{r eval = TRUE}
# aggregated data greater than 0
aggregatedPhysicalData <- aggregatedPhysicalData[aggregatedPhysicalData$total > 0, ]
# sort in descending order
aggregatedPhysicalData <- aggregatedPhysicalData[order(aggregatedPhysicalData$total, decreasing = TRUE), ]

# renumber rows in descending order
rownames(aggregatedPhysicalData) <- 1:nrow(aggregatedPhysicalData)

# top 10
aggregatedPhysicalDataTop10 <- aggregatedPhysicalData[1:10, ]
```

Calculate property and crop loss based on exponent multipliers
```{r eval = TRUE}
data$propertyLoss <- data$propdmg * data$propdmgexp
data$cropLoss <- data$cropdmg * data$cropdmgexp
```

Aggregate data for economic data, calculating totals
```{r eval = TRUE}
aggregatedEconomicData <- aggregate(cbind(propertyLoss, cropLoss) ~ evtype, data = data, FUN = sum)
# create total field 
aggregatedEconomicData$total <- aggregatedEconomicData$propertyLoss + aggregatedEconomicData$cropLoss
```

Determine events with the highest economic impact
```{r eval = TRUE}
# aggregated data greater than 0
aggregatedEconomicData <- aggregatedEconomicData[aggregatedEconomicData$total > 0, ]
# sort in descending order
aggregatedEconomicData <- aggregatedEconomicData[order(aggregatedEconomicData$total, decreasing = TRUE), ]

# renumber rows in descending order
rownames(aggregatedEconomicData) <- 1:nrow(aggregatedEconomicData)

# top 10
aggregatedEconomicDataTop10 <- aggregatedEconomicData[1:10, ]
```

## Results

```{r eval = TRUE}
# melt id variables evtype 
physicalDataTop10Melt <- melt(aggregatedPhysicalDataTop10, id.vars = "evtype")

# build ggplot of top 10 
physicalChart <- ggplot(physicalDataTop10Melt, aes(x = reorder(evtype, -value), y = value)) +
                        geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = variable), position = "dodge") +
                        scale_y_sqrt("Frequency count") +
                        xlab("Event type") +
                        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
                        ggtitle("Top 10 US storm physical health impacts")
